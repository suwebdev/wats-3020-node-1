## I/O for this code  
Use the local module **getargs** to pull a single argument out of the command line for input.  Use `console.log(<string>)` for output.

## Variable Declaration
JavaScript has 4 ways to declare a variables: `var`, `const`, `let`, just use the name:
```JavaScript
var a = 10
const a = 10
let a = 10
a=10
```
The syntax for `const` and `let` are part of the ES6 syntax and can be used in node or in browser and are preferred.  Using `var` and no syntax for declaration have similar effect and make the variable global in it's function space, or lexically scoped.  This is more confusing for programmers and is generally avoided although you'll still see it used a lot.  A variable declared with `const` can not be set to another value, although, when we were with object, you'll see that properties within a **const** object can be reset.  A variable declared with `let` can be reset and is block scoped.  Block scoping means the variable is only know within the block (pair of curly braces or page if not within curly braces) in which it is declared.

## Variable Types
JavaScript is a [loosely typed language](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strong_and_weak_typing), but it recognizes the types referenced in its variables.  There is a `typeof` operator that can return the type of a variable; for example
```JavaScript
let n = 3
typeof n  //returns "number"
```
There are 7 types in JavaScript
* **number** which includes **integer** (no decimal places) and **floating-point** (decimal places)
* **string** which are used for text and you can picture of strings as a string of characters
* **boolean** which hold values of **true** or **false** 
* **null** which can hold a single value of **null** 
* **undefined** which holds a single value of **undefined**

Null and Undefined are differentiated in the fact that **null** is a value that you must assign to a variable, whereas **undefined** is the default value of a variable for which you don't assign anything.

## Object vs Primitive Types
The types associated with numbers, strings, booleans, null, undefined types as discussed above are referred to as **primitive**.  We'll be learning about Object in a future module.  Objects can encapsulate (contain) primitive values.  The main difference between primitive and object types from a programming point of view is that primitives are **immutable**.  For example if if I have a string decalred as `let s = "hello"`, I can't change the "e" to an "a" in "hello".  I can create a new string `s = "hallo"`, but I can't do something like `s[0] = "a"`.  That is I can't go into the contents of the string and change it.  
Objects are mutable.  If I have an object `let obj = {a:1}` I can change the value of a in the object like this: `obj.a = 2`.  
In JavaScript there are "wrapper" objects for the primitive types: String, Number, Boolean which provide some functionality. Notice that the object wrapper names are capitalized.  This is a common convention to refer to primitive types with lower case names and object types with upper case names. In this module, we're working with primitives to understand the types of data they can hold, and we'll look at some methods provided by some of the wrapper object types. 

## String methods
We're not writing functions and objects in this assignment, but we're using them in the form of type  **methods**.  The term **method** is sometimes used interchangeably with **function**.  There are many [string methods](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/String).  In this assignment you'll use the `indexOf` function to determine if a string contains a substring. This function is called as follows:
```JavaScript
let s = "string"
s.indexOf("s")
```
The call to `indexOf` above would return the value `0` because the letter `s` is found in the 0th position.  Counting starts at 0.  

```JavaScript
let s = "string"
s.indexOf("Q")
```
The call to indexOf above would return the value `-1` because that it what the function returns when the value can't be found.  That means a good logical test for the existence of a character in a string is `s.indexOf("Q") > -1`.

## Number methods
Like strings, numbers have [number methods](https://www.w3schools.com/js/js_number_methods.asp). The `toFixed()` method helps us to provide decimal places to a number with decimals.  When you use division `\`, even on integers, you can get decimals places.  Notice, in the example below that toFixed returns a string and will apply rounding rules.
```JavaScript
let n = 1
n/6 //returns 0.16666666666666666
(n/6).toFixed(2) //returns "0.17"

```

## Operators
Operators are functions that have a symbolic shorthand; for example instead of saying "add" we have a plus sign "+" operator.  
Every type has a [set of operators](https://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_operators.asp) that can be applied to a variable of that type.

## Logic
In an imperative language, like JavaScript, the flow of the instructions is often linear in nature. In other words, when one command is complete, the next line of code is executed.  Sometimes we want to change the flow of the code based on the status of certain variables.  Variable contain the data, or state, of the program.  We are often writing data driven applications.  One of the ways to change the flow of the program is to use logic.  We can create logical expressions by using logical operators.  

Whereas variables with a boolean type will always return true or false, we can create expressions which return true or false using logical operators.  We can also use AND `&&` and OR `||` to combine logical expression, thereby creating more complex logical tests.  Program flow is often described visually using flowcharts like this flowchart that looks at the value of temperature ![flowchart that looks at the value of temperature](https://www.edrawsoft.com/flowchart/images/flowchart-simple-sample.png).  


## if/else
You can use the `if/else if/else` syntax to test logical expressions and change the code that is executed based on the results of evaluating the expression.  

The syntax for if/else if/else includes a logical expression surrounded by parentheses.  For each `if`, `else if` or `else` a block expression follows.  If there is only one statement in the block you don't need curly braces, but using curly braces is required if there are multiple statements.

The code for the flowchart in the image above might look like this: 
```JavaScript
let temperature = 15 //degrees
if (temperature < 32){
  console.log("Below Freezing")
} else if (temperature === 32){
  console.log("Freezing")
}
} else {
  console.log("Above Freezing)
}
```

## ternary operators
You can use ternary operators to test the value of a logical operator and return a value of true or false depending on whether the logical operator evaluates to true or false.  The syntax is:
```
<logical operator> ? <value if true> : <value if false>
```
You can see that it's a shorthand for if/else
```
if (<logical expression>) <value if true> else <value if false>
```
Here's an example:
```JavaScript
let a = 1
let b = 2
let c = a < b ? "a is less than b" : "a is greater than b"
```
At the end of the above code c would equal "a is less than b"


## Template Literals
You'll learn that you can concatenate strings with other string and numbers to create new strings.  However, with ES6, we have **literal templates** to create string composed of literals and variables.  The syntax uses a pair backtick characters **`** (key to the left of the 1 on most keyboards) to enclose a set of strings and variables.  Variables are enclosed in **${}** within the backticks to show the value of the variable.
```JavaScript
let s = "Hello"
let name = "Sally"
`${s} ${name}, how are you today?` // returns "Hello Sally, how are you today?
```
The ability to combine literals and variables can be use to create new strings or to log data using the console.log() function.  We call the placing of string within the template literal "interpolation".  A template literal may span multiple lines of text.

## Tutorials
Fork this repository.  
In order to successfully complete this assignment, you must find and complete the **TODOs** in the code:

**1-odd-even**
Add code to replace the TODO's in 1-odd-even/index.js  
  - Test that the user entered an integer: `isNan(input)` will test that the input is a number and `Number.isInteger(input)` will test the number is an integer.and that the number is an integer.  Using `||`.  Set up logical expressions and if/else so that you can provide a **usage** statement to tell the user how to run the program using node if a number is not found.
  ```JavaScript
    isNaN(input) || !Number.isInteger(input)

    //usage
    console.log("usage: node 1-odd-even/index.js <integer>")
  ```
  - Write a logical expression to test if the input integer is divisible by 2.  You can use the modulo (remainder) operator `%` to create a logical expression.
  ```JavaScript
  input % 2 === 0
  ```
  - Report "odd" if the input is odd and "even" if it is even 
  ```JavaScript
  console.log(`${input} is even`)

  console.log(`${input} is odd`)
  ``` 

**2-string-contains**    
Add code to replace the TODO's in 2-string-contains/index.js  
  - Test that the user entered a string and log a usage statements to let the user know that a string is expected and that a string with spaces needs to be quotes
  ```JavaScript
  console.log("usage: node 2-string-contains/index.js <string>")
  console.log("if string contains a space, put it in quotes")
  ```
  - Write an expression to test if the input string contains hello and find the position in which is being within the input using the `indexOf` method
  ```JavaScript
  input.indexOf("hello") > -1
  ```
  - Log if hello is found and at what position, of it the input string doesn't contain it log that
  ```JavaScript
  `input contains hello at location ${input.indexOf("hello")}`

  `input does not contain the string "hello"`  
  ```

**3-types**  
Add code to replace TODO's in 3-types/index.js  
  - Use the `typeof` operator to display what JavaScript sees as the types of constant value provide
  ```JavaScript
  typeof <value to test>
  ```
  - Translate text to code to add strings and numbers to see how string concatenation using the `+` operator is affected by order
  ```JavaScript
  //use the + sign with different type values
  ```
  - Log the values of strings comparing string concatenation with `+` to concatenation with `+=`.  Notice that `+=` changes the value of the left hand operand.
  ```JavaScript
  //console.log the values of expressions and results
  ```
  - Add ternary functions using the constant value to see how JavaScript creates "truthy" and "falsy" values out of strings and other types.  This can be useful in creating logical expressions.  Ternary functions will look something like this `CONSTANT ? true : false`
  ```JavaScript
  <value> ? true : false
  ```  
**4-hours-to-minutes**  
Add code to replace TODO's in 4-hours-to-minutes/index.js
  - Check input using isNaN and Number.isInteger to ensure user enter a number
  ```JavaScript
   isNaN(input) || !Number.isInteger(input)
  ```
  - Provide a usage statement in case user didn't enter a number
  ```JavaScript
   console.log("usage: node 4-hours-to-minutes/index.js <integer>")
  ``` 
  - Calculate number of hours using division and .toFixed to round to 0 decimals
  ```JavaScript
    let hours = (input/60).toFixed(0)
  ```
  - Calculate number of minutes remaining using modulo (remainder)
  ```JavaScript
    let minutes = input % 60
  ```
  - Use ternary operator to determine singular or plural hours
  ```JavaScript
    let hrs = hours > 1 ? "hours" : "hour"
  ```
  - Use a ternary to determine singular or plural minutes
  ```JavaScript
    let mins = minutes > 1 ? "minutes" : "minute"
  ```

## Stretch Goals

1. Create an app to determine if a number is divisible by 3 or 7.
2. Research the string methods and write an app that uses the search or substr method to find a string within a string.
3. Research the string methods and write an app the determines how long a string is.
4. Research the number methods and write an app the converts a string containing a integer into a numeric integer.  This is a useful bit of code, since we often pull strings off the web when accessing data and need to convert it into numbers in our code.
